# React Developer API Code Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome! This project utilizes a fake products API to fetch and display information about various products.

## Getting Started

Before running this application, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.   
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open your terminal and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Once the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. You can now view the application in your browser by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
This script runs all the tests included in the project. Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production to the `build` folder.  
It optimizes the build for better performance and prepares the application for deployment.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes to ensure cache busting.
